    Maren Hassinger’s life and career bridge Los Angeles and Baltimore. An LA native and 1973 UCLA graduate, Hassinger was active with an experimental group of artists in the city, including Senga Nengudi and David Hammons, during the 1970s. Hassinger’s work of this time, as well as that of her colleagues has recently been chronicled in Kellie Jones’s book _South of Pico: African American Artists in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s_. Hassinger then moved to the East Coast, spending time in New York City and East Hampton before becoming the Director of the Rinehart School of Graduate Sculpture at Baltimore’s prestigious Maryland Institute College of Art, a position she has held since 1997. Alongside her solo work, Hassinger has continued collaborations with Nengudi and performed with her daughter, artist Ava Hassinger, under the name “Matriarch.” She is now based in New York City.

    Recognized as an influential teacher and a pioneer of such ephemeral practices as performance and site-specific interventions, Hassinger has received numerous honors including awards and grants from Anonymous Was a Woman, the International Association of Art Critics, the Gottlieb Foundation, the Joan Mitchell Foundation, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.

    She was the subject of a 2015 retrospective at Spelman College Museum of Art in Atlanta. Her work was also included in the recent traveling group exhibitions _Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960-1980_ (originating at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles and traveling to PS1, Long Island City; and Williams College, Williamstown, MA) and _Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art_ (originating at the Contemporary Art Museum, Houston; and traveling to the Grey Art Gallery and Studio Museum, New York; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco), as well as the 2017 exhibition _We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965-85_ at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
