    Multidisciplinary artist **Dale Brockman Davis** is an artist, teacher, community arts activist, and curator.  Co-founder with his brother, Alonzo Brockman Davis, of the Brockman Gallery, a Leimert Park institution, Davis creates multimedia artworks that center upon the use of color, texture, and form to capture histories of the past.

    Davis has shown his work in numerous exhibitions, galleries, and contemporary art forums, including the Hammer Museum, Roberts & Tilton Gallery, the San Luis Obispo Museum of Art, the Watts Towers Art Center, and the California African American Museum.  In 1997, Davis received acknowledgement for his cultural contributions to the community by the California State Senate.  More recently, he was awarded for outstanding cultural contributions by two Los Angeles city officials: Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in 2009 and Council Member Bernard Parks in 2012.

  biography_text: |-
    **Alonzo J. Davis'** career as an artist spans four decades. A native of Tuskegee, Alabama, Davis moved with his family to Los Angeles in his early teens. After acquiring an undergraduate degree at Pepperdine College he earned an MFA in Design at Otis Art Institute. Influenced early on by the assemblagists, Davis soon took wing and began to experiment with a variety of mediums, techniques and themes. Inspired by travel to Africa, the Caribbean and American Southwest-the colors and patterns of Pacific Rim cultures also seeped into Davis' artwork. During the '70's and early '80's, his involvement in the California mural movement culminated with the 1984 Olympic Murals project.

    Davis entered new territory literally and figuratively when he moved from Los Angeles to Sacramento, California in '87. Fellowships in Hawaii and Texas inaugurated new bodies of work and led to job opportunities in academia--deanships at the San Antonio Art Institute and the Memphis College of Art. During this period his on-going Blanket Series of woven paintings-morphed into a series of installations: _Christopher Columbus Did Not Discover America_ which incorporated light elements, rocks and arrows, and the _Tar Paper Series_, richly-textured organic forms that Davis "choreographed" onto large walls. These works signaled a transition from 2-D to 3-D and commissions to create public art for the Boston Subway, Atlanta International Airport, a shopping mall and new main library in Tennessee.

    A resident of Maryland for the past 10 years, Davis' works out of his studio at Montpelier Arts Center in Laurel. He continues to create for the public art sphere.
