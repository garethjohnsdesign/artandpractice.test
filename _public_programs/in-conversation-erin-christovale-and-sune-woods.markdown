abstract_text: In 1982 Prince gave us "Little Red Corvette" and I guess we should
  have known that relationships are ephemeral.  Loving in the eighties was turbulent
  and the socio-political climate propelled us into the '90s Culture Wars. During
  this decade Al Loving used the spiral as an infinite gesture that speaks to life’s
  continuum. Erin Christovale and Suné Woods will discuss cultural production during
  this time and vulnerabilities that resonate now.

  biography_text: "Suné Woods is an artist living in Los Angeles. Her work takes the
    form of video installations, photographs, and collage. Woods' practice examines
    absences and vulnerabilities within cultural and social histories. She also uses
    microsomal sites such as family to understand larger sociological phenomenon,
    imperialist mechanisms, & formations of knowledge. She is interested in how language
    is emoted, guarded, and translated through the absence/presence of a physical
    body.\n\nShe has participated in residencies at Headlands Center of the Arts,
    Vermont Studio Center, The Center for Photography at Woodstock, and Light Work.
    Woods is a recipient of the Visions from the New California Initiative Award,
    The John Gutmann Fellowship Award, and The Baum Award for an Emerging American
    Photographer. \n\nWoods has served as Visiting Faculty in the CalArts Photography
    & Media Program, Vermont College of Fine Arts Visual Art Program, and has mentored
    fellows and organized lectures with at land’s edge, a platform for visual research
    and catalyst for decolonial thought and action in Los Angeles."
