  biography_text: 'Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle is an interdisciplinary visual artist, writer
    and performer. Her practice fluctuates between collaborations and participatory
    projects with alternative gallery spaces within various communities to projects
    that are intimate and based upon her private experiences in relationship to historical
    events and contexts. A term that has become a mantra for her practice is the "Historical
    Present," as she examines the residue of history and how it affects our contemporary
    world perspective. Her artwork and experimental writing has been exhibited and
    performed at the Studio Museum in Harlem, Project Row Houses, the Hammer Museum,
    the Museum of Art at the University of New Hampshire, the Museum of the African
    Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco, the Made in LA 2012 Biennial and the BALTIC
    Centre for Contemporary Art, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Hinkle’s work has been reviewed
    by the _Los Angeles Times_, _LA Weekly_, _Artforum_, _Hyperallergic_, the _Huffington
    Post_, the _Washington Post_ and the _New York Times_. She is also the recipient
    of several awards including the Cultural Center for Innovation’s Investing in
    Artists Grant, Social Practice in Art (SPart-LA), Jacob K Javits Fellowship for
    Graduate Study, The Fulbright Student Fellowship, and The Rema Hort Mann Foundation
    Emerging Artists Award. Her writing has appeared in _Not That But This_, _Obsidian
    Journal_, _Among Margins: Critical & Lyrical Writing on Aesthetics_, and she has
    a forthcoming first book called _SIR_, a reflection on naming as a tool for undefining
    the defined, that will be published with Litmus Press. Hinkle’s critically acclaimed
    solo show _The Evanesced_ focused on the erasure of black women historically and
    presently debuted at the California African American Museum in Los Angeles in
    the spring of 2017.'

  biography_text: Ramsess is a self-taught artist and educator who works in multiple
    mediums, including textiles, painting, mosaic, illustration, and stained glass.
    He contributed political cartoons and illustrations to the _Los Angeles Times_
    from 1976 to 1994. A longtime resident and leading creative voice in Leimert Park,
    Ramsess began renting his Degnan Boulevard studio from Dale and Alonzo Davis of
    Brockman Gallery in 1981, where he lived and worked until 2002.  A Los Angeles
    native, Ramsess continues to live and work in Leimert Park.  A life-long fan and
    lover of blues and jazz music, much of his art is a reflection of that interest,
    honoring the musicians and the music they create.  He frequently travels the country
    to sell his Jazz-focused works at music festivals.  Ramsess is a member of the
    Afro-American Quilters of Los Angeles, a partner of the Alliance for California
    Traditional Arts.

    Angeles in 1987. He served as director of the Watts Towers Arts Center from 1993
