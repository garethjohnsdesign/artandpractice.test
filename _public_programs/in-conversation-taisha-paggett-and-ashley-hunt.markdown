  biography_text: Taisha Paggett is a Southern California-based dance artist whose
    individual and collaborative interdisciplinary works re-articulate and collide
    specific western choreographic practices with the politics of daily life to interrogate
    fixed notions of queer black embodiment and survival. Such works include the dance
    company project, WXPT (we are the paper, we are the trees) and the School for
    the Movement of the Technicolor People, both of which seek to radicalize questions
    held within contemporary dance by way of intersecting with social practice; radical
    pedagogy; somatic and contemplative investigations; queer, feminist and Black
    studies; performance and visual art; and the political and philosophical meshes
    of personal history. Paggett's work has been supported by the University of California
    Institute for Research in the Arts; Clockshop; the MAP Fund (in conjunction with
    Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions); the National Performance Network; Diverseworks
    in Houston; and Danspace Project in New York, amongst other institutions. From
    2005-2013, Paggett co-instigated the LA-based dance project and discursive platform,
    itch, and was featured in Velvetpark magazine’s most significant queer women of
    2014 list. As a dancer, Paggett has worked collaboratively, toured with and made
    significant creative contributions to many choreographers and performance projects
    including that of Every House Has a Door, David Roussève/REALITY, Victoria Marks,
    Kelly Nipper, Meg Wolfe and Yael Davids, with whom she recently performed for
    Documenta 14. Since 2009 Paggett has maintained an ongoing collaborative practice
    with Ashley Hunt titled _On movement, thought and politics_. She is currently
    assistant professor of Dance at UC Riverside.

  biography_text: 'Ashley Hunt uses images, objects, writing and performance to engage
    social ideas and actions, including those of social movements, daily life, movement
    and the exercise of political power, and the disciplinary boundaries that separate
    our art worlds from the larger worlds in which they sit. Hunt has dedicated the
    bulk of his career to documenting the expansion of the U.S. prison system, as
    it expresses and continues the U.S.’ racial and economic histories. His current
    project, Degrees of Visibility, examines this through landscape studies, studying
    the everyday camouflage of contemporary prisons from public view as a visual politics
    that enables today’s mass imprisonment. This follows his 16-year Corrections Documentary
    Project, a body of ten videos, photographic works and mappings addressing the
    politics of prison expansion and the work communities do to resist it. Hunt’s
    ongoing collaboration with Taisha Paggett takes up some of these same questions
    and others through the body, movement, performance and pedagogy, with their _Par
    Course_ series and their collaborative work on the School of the Movement of the
    Technicolor People, with Kim Zumpfe and the dance company, WXPT. Hunt’s works
    have been presented in venues ranging from Wonderroot Community Art Center in
    Atlanta, the Eric Quizada Center for Art and Politics in San Francisco, to Los
    Angeles’ LACE the Hammer Museums’ 2012 Made in L.A., Project Row Houses and Diverseworks
    in Houston, Beta Local in Puerto Rico, the Blackwood Gallery in Toronto, to the
    Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern and Documenta 12, to grassroots community
    centers, prisons, bookstores, spaces of worship and activist forums throughout
    the U.S. and abroad. Hunt’s recent writing has appeared in the LA Review of Books,
    the Oxford Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice (2017), _Public Servants:
    Art and the Crisis of the Common Good_ (MIT Press 2016), _Social Medium: Artists
    Writing: 2000-2015_, (Paper Monument 2016), X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly (2014),
    Shifter Magazine #20 (2013). Hunt directs the Program in Photography and Media
    at CalArts.'
