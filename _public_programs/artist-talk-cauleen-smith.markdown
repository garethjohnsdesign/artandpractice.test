  Chicago-based interdisciplinary artist whose work reflects on the everyday possibilities
  of the imagination. Smith roots her work firmly within the discourse of mid-twentieth
  century experimental film, and draws from structuralism, international cinema, and
  science fiction. Smith’s films, installations, and objects deploy the tactics of
  these disciplines, while offering a phenomenological experience for spectators and
  participants. '
