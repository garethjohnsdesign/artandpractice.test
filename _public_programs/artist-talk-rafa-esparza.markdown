  biography_text: 'rafa esparza is a multidisciplinary artist who was born, raised,
    and is currently living in Los Angeles. Woven into esparza’s bodies of work are
    his interests in history, personal narratives, and kinship. He is inspired by
    his own relationship to colonization and the disrupted genealogies that come forth
    as a result. Using live performance as his main form of inquiry, esparza employs
    site-specificity, materiality, memory and (non)documentation as primary tools
    to interrogate and critique ideologies, power structures and binaries that problematize
    the “survival” process of historicized narratives and the environments wherein
    people are left to navigate and socialize. esparza’s recent projects have evolved
    through experimental collaborative projects grounded in laboring with land vis
    a vis adobe brick making, a labor inherited by his father Ramon Esparza, where
    the artist diverts institutional resources to invited Brown and Queer cultural
    producers to collectively manifest large scale projects, and in the process brings
    people to gather to build networks of support and validation out side of traditional
    art spaces. Esparza is committed and invested in working in the local geographies
    that are the Southwest including Mexico and Latin-America. He has performed in
    a variety of spaces, public and private, throughout Los Angeles including Elysian
    Park, The Los Angeles River, AIDS Project Los Angeles, Highways Performance Space,
    REDCAT, Human Resources, Vincent Price Museum, LACE, has shown around the U.S.
    in places that include The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Bemis Center for
    Contemporary Art, Ballroom Marfa, and internationally at Oficina de Procesos,
    Mexicali, and El Museo del Chopo in CDMX. esparza was part of the 2018 spring
    cohort at the renowned Artpace Artist in Residence program in San Antonio, Texas,
    and recently led a guerrilla processional performance with over 25 artists through
    the historic fashion thoroughfare market The Santee Alley as part of his project
    _de la Calle_ at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. '
