    Born in Oceanside, CA, in 1974, Ruben Ochoa’s practice engages space as both a concept and a material. Often produced with material forms associated with construction, Ochoa’s works expose the ideological and broader sociopolitical and economic relationships that facilitate the way spaces we inhabit and move through are assembled.

    His work has been the subject of various solo exhibitions, including, _Watching, Waiting, Commiserating_, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA (2016); _MATRIX 169: Cloudless Day_, Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford, CT (2014); _Cores and Cutouts_, Locust Projects, Miami, FL (2011); _Building on the Fringes of Tomorrow_, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA (2010); and _Crooked Under the Weight_, Site Santa Fe, Santa Fe, NM (2009) amongst others.

(2017); _99 cents or Less_, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, MI (2017); _Mi Tierra_, Denver Art Museum, Denver, CO (2017); _Routes of Influence_, Perez Art Museum, Miami, FL (2016); _Apparition: Frottages and Rubbings from 1860 to Now_, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA and Menil Collection, Houston, TX (2015); _X-Change_, Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, TX (2013); _The Future Generation Art Prize Exhibition_, Venice, Italy (2011); _The Artist’s Museum: Los Angeles Artists 1980-2010_, Museum of Contemporary, Los Angeles, CA (2010); _Phantom Sighting_, LACMA, Los Angeles, CA (2008); and the 2008 Whitney Biennial, New York, NY amongst others.

    In addition to his exhibitions, Ochoa has completed various public art projects including, most notably, _Fwy Wall Extraction_ (2006-2007) and _CLASS: C_ (2001-2005). Ochoa’s work is included in the collections of the Perez Art Museum, the Hammer Museum, LACMA, the MCA San Diego; MOCA; the Phoenix Art Museum; the Smithsonian Museum of Art; the Orange County Museum of Art; and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
