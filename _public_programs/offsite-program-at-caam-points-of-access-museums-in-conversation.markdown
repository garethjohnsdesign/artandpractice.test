In four public programs, CAAM and A+P welcome artists, collectors, curators, and museum administrators to discuss their diverse paths and how they have navigated the art world at each point in their careers. The series is designed for individuals at all levels of familiarity with contemporary art; no prior knowledge is required and all are welcome.  This talk will include jill moniz, Academic Curator at the Pomona College Museum of Art, Pilar Tompkins Rivas, Director of the Vincent Price Art Museum, and Allison Agsten, Director of the Main Museum.
