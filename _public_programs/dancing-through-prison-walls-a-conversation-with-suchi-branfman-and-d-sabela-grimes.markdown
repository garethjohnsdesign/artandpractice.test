abstract_text: Organized by activist, educator, and choreographer Suchi Branfman in
  2017, _Inside Outside_ brought a group of choreographers and artists to share their
  work and creative process with incarcerated men inside the California Rehabilitation
  Center, a medium-security state men’s prison in Norco, California. In deep collaboration
  with these incarcerated men earlier in the year, Branfman had spent three months
  co-choreographing _SUSTAIN_ around the question “what sustains you?” She will be
  in conversation with multidisciplinary artist and educator d. Sabela Grimes, who
  joined Branfman and other artists at the California Rehabilitation Center to teach
  and share choreography from his work _Bulletproof Deli_, that complicates constructed
  notions of masculinity and manhood within the confines of a “Chinese” take-out spot
  in North Philadelphia. Join Art + Practice to discuss their experience creating
  and sharing their art with incarcerated individuals through prison walls.

  biography_text: 'd. Sabela grimes, 2017 County of Los Angeles Performing Arts Fellow
    and 2014 United States Artists Rockefeller Fellow, is a trans-media storyteller,
    sonic ARKivist, movement composer cultivating a devoted interest in Afrobiquitous
    life practices.  Sabela has conceived, written, scored, choreographed and produced
    several dance theater works including _BulletProof Deli_, plus _Philly XP_, _World
    War WhatEver_, and _40 Acres & A Microchip: Salvation or Servitude_ from his _EXPERIMENT
    EARTH_ sound-movement triptych. Recent creative projects include, _ELECTROGYNOUS_
    (2017) and _Dark Matter Messages_ (2018). _ELECTROGYNOUS_ is a dance theater experience
    which articulates that Black gender qualities are infinite, multi-dimensional
    and distinct manifestations of wombniversal consciousness.  _Dark Matter Messages_
    is a collection of live poetry, video projections and music interwoven with improvisational
    movement meditations that realize AfroFuturism as a means to play within the nowness
    of impending futures. Moved by how Octavia E. Butler invents interrelated notions
    of humanness in her Parable Series, _Dark Matter Messages_ dreams Butler’s unfinished
    manuscript, _Parable of the Trickster_, into a live performance experience. Sabela
    is also active as composer/sound designer for two dance theater projects, CONTRA-TIEMPO’s
    _joyUS_, and David Rousseve/REALITY’s _Halfway to Dawn_, both set to premier in
    2018/2019. On the faculty at USC’s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, he continues
    to cultivate _Funkamental MediKinetics_, a movement system he created that focuses
    on the methodical dance training and community building elements evident in Hip
    Hop, Black vernacular and Street dance forms. Sabela loves pancakes, declarative
    realness and his kinfolk.'
