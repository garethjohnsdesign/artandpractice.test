    May Sun is a Los Angeles based artist who has exhibited her work nationally and internationally. Her work is in numerous private and public collections, and her room-sized installation _UnderGround_ is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles. She first received critical attention for her multi media performance art piece _The Great Wall or How Red Is My China?_ in the mid 80s which was originally performed at LACE in Los Angeles. She subsequently created large scale multi-media installations where the visitor is engulfed by visual, aural and at times olfactory senses. These spatially expansive, culturally relevant site specific installations in museums and art institutions such as the Santa Monica Museum of Art and Capp Street Project in San Francisco led to her first public art commission, when she was selected to be a member of the design team for the Metropolitan Transit Authority's Hollywood Blvd. & Western Ave. Red Line Metro Station in Hollywood, California. She has since received many significant commissions including Union Station Gateway in Los Angeles, the Robert F. Kennedy Inspiration Park, an award winning urban park that honors the life and work of Robert Kennedy at the site of the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, a terrazzo floor for the San Antonio International Airport, and a public plaza in front of the gateway to Chinatown in Boston, Massachusetts.

    Her work strives to uncover rich cultural and environmental connections that are unique to each site that will resonate for the public and future generations to come. She has worked in collaboration with fellow visual artists, theatre artists, composers, architects and other design professionals. Awards and residencies include two National Endowment for the Arts awards in New Genres, a Getty Visual Artists Fellowship, a California Arts Council Artists Fellowship, a Vesta award for Performance Art from the Woman’s Building, and artist residencies at MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts, ArtPace in San Antonio, Texas and at the Monet Foundation in Giverny, France.

    She has been a visiting artist at universities across the country, and was a faculty member at California Institute of the Arts and at Otis College of Art and Design where her students designed an international public art monument for the people of Palau in Micronesia. She was the 2017-2018 artist in residence at the Rinehart School of Sculpture at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, Maryland.

    Sun was born in Shanghai, China, raised in the British colony of Hong Kong and has lived in California since the age of sixteen. She received her B.A. in Art from UCLA and was in the MFA program at Otis Art Institute.
