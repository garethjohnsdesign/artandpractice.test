    Alile Sharon Larkin is an acclaimed L.A. Rebellion filmmaker and multicultural artist-educator. Her films, *Your Children Come Back To You* (1979), *A Different Image* (1982) and *The Kitchen* (1975), have screened at community centers, libraries, film festivals and exhibitions, universities and museums locally, nationally and internationally. A partial list of the diverse venues Larkin's films have been showcased include the British Film Institute, BAMcinematek, MoMA, Cinema du Reel, Iconic Black Panther, The Black Cinema House, Black Portraitures III, Whitney Museum, Smithsonian Museum, Howard University’s James A. Porter Colloquium, KAOS Network, Mercado La Paloma, King Center, Malcolm X Center, William Grant Still Art Center, Filmex and London Black Film Festival.

    As a public school teacher with LAUSD, Larkin made filmmaking a part of her elementary classroom curriculum for over twenty-five years. Larkin was awarded ten Video-in-the-Classroom awards (VICs) from KLCS-TV for teacher-produced videos that documented student learning in textile arts, storytelling, yoga, jazz, women’s history, Kwanzaa and African-inspired dance. Larkin’s films for children include *Dreadlocks and the Three Bears* and *Mz Medusa*.  *Mz Medusa* was a collaborative effort of students, teachers, administrators, parents, professional crew and actors.  Her documentary Miss Fluci Moses is a tribute to the local librarian, poet and beloved aunt of Alonzo and Dale Davis (Brockman Gallery).

    Larkin continues to create art and media that validates and celebrates global Black life through Dreadlocks and the Three Bears Productions. Current projects include a picture-book version of her award-winning children’s video, *Dreadlocks and the Three Bears*, *Tie-Dye: A Children’s Music DVD* and *The Kitchen: A Visual Companion* to her first film.  Larkin’s work is made possible by the collaborative efforts of a multigenerational group of filmmakers, artists, designers, educators and performers who are dedicated to making art for a better world.
