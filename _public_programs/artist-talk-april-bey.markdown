abstract_text: "Join Art + Practice on November 8 for a talk with Bahamian raised,
  LA-based multidisciplinary artist and educator April Bey. Bey will discuss the ideas
  addressed in her _Made in Space_ series, which explores female and queer afrofuturistic
  millennial entrepreneurialism via social media and the Internet. Blerdy in nature,
  juxtapositions of Star Trek and hip-hop culture also manifest in this series. Looking
  to the future acts as a therapeutic excretory practice in dealing with current day
  issues around race and discrimination globally. She will touch on the British colonization
  of West Africa and The Bahamas in comparison to the current Chinese colonization
  of black countries.\n \nThis work is a focus but is part of a generalized exploration
  of the actual resilience of women as they navigate through high-impact experiences
  of the body, psyche and demands of womanhood. There’s an ironic hypocrisy in the
  expectations of women and specifically black women to be sovereign and robust while
  at the same time inept and emotionally weak/unpredictable when leadership roles
  are sought."
