abstract_text: 'In their respective works, painter Njideka Akunyili Crosby and filmmaker
  and video artist Akosua Adoma Owusu explore their experiences as African artists
  living and work in the United States. Akunyili Crosby creates complex, large-scale,
  mixed media works that incorporate references to her Nigerian heritage through images
  and textiles, while considering the social and personal effects of living abroad.
  Owusu uses an experimental, cinematic language to visualize what she has termed
  “triple consciousness,” an adaptation of sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois’s conception
  of black American identity after emancipation, extended to the experience of African
  expatriates. On the occasion of their exhibitions, _Njideka Akunyili Crosby: The
  Beautyful Ones and Two Films by Akosua Adoma Owusu_, the artists will reflect on
  their own and each other’s work, in conversation with Jamillah James, assistant
  curator at the Hammer Museum, and organizer of their exhibitions at Art + Practice.'
