  biography_text: Renata Cherlise is a multidisciplinary, research-based visual artist
    who uses various mediums to explore themes of identity, familial interiors, and
    cultural practices. Cherlise's work seamlessly bridges her southern upbringing
    with contemporary methodologies in digital and physical spaces while reimagining
    notions of the Black experience. Her archival project, Blvck Vrchives, has evolved
    from a photo-based website of visual narratives, into a collaborative platform
    featuring archival histories and modern-day stories from across the African diaspora.
