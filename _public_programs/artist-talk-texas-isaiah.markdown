  biography_text: "texas isaiah is a visual narrator from Brooklyn, NY. He currently
    resides in Los Angeles, and mainly creates visual archives in NYC, LA, San Francisco,
    and Oakland. His work explores gender, race, and sexuality by inviting the sitter
    to participate in the photographic process. The invitation constructs a space
    to begin and continue collaborative visual dialogues about legacy, self-empowerment,
    emotional justice, protection, and topophilia (the affective bond between people
    and place). texas isaiah is invested in the possibilities of what it can mean
    to be seen, loved, and cared for when you have your photograph taken. \n\ntexas

    the Kitchen (NYC), the Studio Museum in Harlem (NYC), Charlie James Gallery (Los
    Angeles), Slought Foundation (Philadelphia), and the New Space Center for Photography
    (Portland). \n\nHis work has been featured in FADER, Killens Review of Arts &
    Letters, Paper Safe Magazine, the Photographic Journal, and Spook Mag. texas isaiah's
    work has been featured on several catalogue and book covers including the 2017-2018
