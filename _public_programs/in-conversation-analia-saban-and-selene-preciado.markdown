abstract_text: 'On the occasion of Ruben Ochoa’s exhibition _SAMPLED y SURVEYED_ at
  Art + Practice, Los Angeles-based artist Analia Saban and independent curator Selene
  Preciado will discuss material and process, in relation to current conceptual practices
  of a younger generation of artists such as Ochoa and Saban. The conversation will
  address issues of materiality and present-day concerns in painting and sculpture.
  They will outline moments in conceptualism that since the 1960s have continued to
  subvert traditional ideas of the functionality of specific mediums, such as the
  capacity of medium itself to convey meaning through its loaded histories. '

  biography_text: "Analia Saban dissects and reconfigures traditional notions of painting,
    often using the medium of paint as the subject itself. Blurring the lines between
    painting and sculpture, imagery and objecthood, her work frequently includes plays
    on art historical references and traditions. Paintings expand to sculptural forms
    and sculptures are presented in two dimensions, using the process of trial and
    error with new techniques and technology. Her unconventional methods such as unweaving
    paintings, laser-burning wood and canvas and molding forms in acrylic paint remain
    central to her practice as she continues to explore art-making processes and materials
    in relation to her daily experience. Dealing with issues of fragility, balance,
    technique and experimentation, Saban's connection with everyday objects is at
    the forefront of her investigation of tangible materials and the metaphysical
    properties of artworks.\n \nBorn in 1980 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Saban currently
    works in Los Angeles and lives in New York City. She received a BFA in Visual
    Arts from Loyola University in New Orleans in 2001, followed by an MFA in New
    Genres at the University of California in Los Angeles in 2005.  Saban’s works
    are represented in the collections of the Hammer Museum at UCLA, Museum of Contemporary
    Art, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles; Hessel Museum of Art
    at Bard College in New York; Norton Museum of Art in Florida; Centre Pompidou
    in Paris, and Fundación Proa in Buenos Aires, among others."
