  biography_text: "**Jennie C. Jones** practice mines the territory of Modernism—abstraction
    and minimalism; experimental jazz; and seminal political and social shifts—to
    reveal the complex and often parallel legacies of the mid-20th century’s social,
    cultural, and political experimentations.  Jones brings to light the unlikely
    alliances that emerged between the visual arts and the imprint of jazz, highlighting
    the way they became and continue to exist as tangible markers of social evolution
    and political strivings. \n\n\nJones attended Rutgers University, Mason Gross
    School of the Arts where she received her Masters of Fine Art degree in 1996.
    Prior to that she attended The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, receiving
    a Bachelors of Fine Art in 1991, with Fellowship.  Her awards include a Pollock-Krasner
    Grant in 2000 and a Creative Capital grant in 2008. She received The William H.
    Johnson Prize in 2008, and is the 2012 recipient of the Studio Museum in Harlem’s
    Wein Prize. She has presented lectures at the Whitney Museum of American Art and
    The High Museum of Art in Atlanta.\n\nJones’ work has been exhibited at major
    art institutions including The Studio Museum in Harlem, The Atlanta Contemporary
    Art Center, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, and Urbis Art Center
    in Manchester, UK among others. Her solo exhibition, Higher Resonance, was presented
    at The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington DC in 2013. Upcoming
    projects include a solo project at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, opening
    in December 2015.\n \nJones has participated in numerous prestigious artists residency
    and fellowship programs, both nationally and international, including: Skowhegan
    School of Painting and Sculpture (1996), The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council
    Residency at the World Trade Center (1999), Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris
    (2002-2003), The Liguria Study Center for the Arts & Humanities in Genoa, Italy
    (2004), and Rauschenberg Foundation Residency in Captiva, Florida (2014). In 2008
