    in the Los Angeles area.  Before documentaries, experimental film and video were

    and video projects include: _Water Ritual #1: An Urban Rite of Purification_,
    _Shopping Bag Spirits and Freeway Fetishes: Reflection on Ritual Space_, _Fragments_,
    and _The World Saxophone Quartet_. Her recently completed film project, _HORACE
    TAPSCOTT: MUSICAL GRIOT_ is a documentary on musical genius, community activist
    and mentor to a generation of accomplished jazz musicians, Horace Tapscott.  \n\nMs.
    McCullough’s works have been exhibited in universities, galleries, museums, festivals
    and programs within the United States and abroad including the Museum of Contemporary
    Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), Hammer Museum, Tate Modern, Whitney Museum, Coursitane

    for Arts, Chicago and the Essay Film Festival in London, England.\n\nBefore recently
    returning to Los Angeles and as a twenty-five plus veteran of the visual effects
    industry, Ms. McCullough was Chair of the Visual Effects Department at Savannah
    College of Art and Design (SCAD)."
