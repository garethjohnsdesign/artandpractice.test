  biography_text: "Shinique Smith is a New York based artist known for her exuberant
    collaged paintings and monumental sculptural works of bound fabric, clothing and
    objects that emphasize notions of belonging\L. Smith creates environments that
    evoke movement and energy, as she culls what she calls the “graceful and spiritual
    qualities of the written word and the everyday” from among the vast nature of
    ‘things’ that we consume and discard, which resonate on a personal and social
    scale. \n\nShinique Smith has had over 20 solo exhibitions and her artwork has
    been exhibited and collected by numerous institutions including: The Museum of
    Fine Arts, Boston, Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum, the Eli and
    Edythe Broad Art Museum (Michigan),The Frist Center for the Visual Arts (Nashville),
    Los Angeles County Museum of Art, MOCA North Miami, the New Museum, The Smithsonian
    National Portrait Gallery and the Whitney Museum of Art, to name a few. Smith’s
    site-specific installation work was presented in The 10th Busan Biennale in Korea
    and the 12th Bienal de Cuenca in Ecuador (2016).\n\nIn addition to exhibiting
    internationally, the artist has produced several iconic public commissions for
    New York Metro Arts in Transit, The Rose F. Kennedy Greenway and MuralArts, as
    well as commissions for the Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority’s Expo Line and
    the Chicago Transit Authority both of which are to be completed in 2018.\n\nShinique
    Smith is the recipient of many awards, fellowships and honors, including the Anonymous
    Was a Woman (2016), the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation (2013), the Joan Mitchell
    Foundation (2008), New York Foundation for the Arts (2007), Headlands Center for
    the Arts (2007), Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (2003-04) and Skowhegan School
    of Painting and Sculpture (2003). In 2012, Shinique was presented with the Alumni
    Medal of Honor from Maryland Institute College of Art, where Shinique earned her
    BFA (1992) and MFA (2003), and where she served on their Board of Trustees (2013-2016).\n\nSmith
    has been featured in several major exhibitions and their publications including,
    _30 Americans,_ The Rubell Family Collection; _Frequency,_ The Studio Museum in
    Harlem; _UnMonumental: The Object in the 21st Century,_ New Museum and Phaidon,
    as well as, Vanderbilt Press and The Frist monograph titled, _Shinique Smith:
    Wonder and Rainbows_.\n\nThe artist is represented by David Castillo Gallery (Miami)
    and Brand New Gallery (Milan)."

Textiles are the art of humanity, which has clothed us for centuries and represented us as both a human innovation and a basic necessity. Woven within fabric and clothing are the ways we communicate and represent ourselves to the world, our family and cultural histories, our experiences and who we aspire to be. 

Discovering connections of memory and cultural identity, within this simple and abundantly common material, is integral to Smith’s process and these possibilities are what make fabric and clothing meaningful to her work conceptually.

The artist will discuss the role that fabric, clothing and objects plays within her collaged paintings and her bound sculptures. Delving into the psychology and motivations of Western consumption of fashion and objects Smith will give insight into her personal attachment to these materials and ideas.
