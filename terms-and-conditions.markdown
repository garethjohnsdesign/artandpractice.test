  of third-party sites, and accept no responsibility for them and hereby disclaim
  all liability related to them. If you decide to access any third-party sites, you

privacy_policy_text: "Your privacy is important to us. The following privacy policy
  outlines the types of information the Art + Practice (“A+P,” “we,” “our,” or “us”)
  gathers when you visit our website (www.artandpractice.org , the “Site”) as well
  as information you provide to us in person or through the mail, and steps we take
  to safeguard it. A+P is located at 3401 W. 43 rd Place, Los Angeles, CA 90008, and
  is responsible for the content of the Site as well as the collection and management
  of user information.\n\nThis Policy was last updated on 11 July, 2018.\n\n**DATA
  CONTROLLER**\n\nA “controller” is the legal entity which, alone or jointly with
  others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. A+P
  is the data controller for all data described by this policy.\n\n**INFORMATION COLLECTION,
  USE, ACCESS, AND RETENTION**\n\n**Collection**\n\nWe collect information in several
  ways through our Site. When you use our Site, we collect personal information about
  you that you affirmatively choose to provide to us. For instance, when you donate,
  you must provide your first name, last name, email address, mailing address, and
  payment information. You may also provide your phone number and/or the name of the
  person that your donation is in honor of or in memory of. We also collect personal
  information in other ways, such as when you sign up for our email list (online or
  in person), contact us by email or traditional mail, and/or contact us by telephone.
  \n\nTo help us serve you better, we collect information that identifies the computer
  or browser used to access our Site, as well as the user account associated with
  that computer/browser if you are logged in. Cookies are pieces of information placed
  in the settings of your web browser by a website server to identify your computer
  when you return to a website. Whenever a site welcomes you and tailors data to your
  specifications, it is reading a cookie left in your browser and identifying information
  that you may have registered during previous visits, such as your viewing preferences.
  The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites and most\nInternet
  web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies
  by user intervention, or to delete cookies. Please note that some website features
  may not function properly if all cookies are blocked. Except as noted below, the
  cookies placed by our Site do not collect any personal information, and are essential
  to provision of a functional website and/or app, which we have a legitimate interest
  in providing (these are known as “Necessary Cookies” and include cookies that drive
  your navigation on one of our Site). Once you leave our Site, these Necessary Cookies
  are no longer used. \n\nWhen you interact with our Site, we also collect limited
  non-personally identifying information that the browser you used makes available
  automatically. This information includes the internet address of the computer or
  network you used to access our site, the date, time, and page(s) you visited on
  our site, the browser and operating system you used, and the referring page (the
  webpage that contained the link to our site that you clicked on to get there).\n\n**Payments**\n\nWhen
  you make a donation, we will collect your payment information. We use stripe.com
  to collect and process your payment information. Your credit card information is
  not held by us and we use stripe.com because the safety of your credit card information
  is important to us, and stripe.com specializes in the secure online capture and
  processing of credit and debit card\ntransactions. As with all our third party vendors,
  we have agreements in place with stripe.com that ensures that the vendor complies
  with the terms of this policy.\n\n**Use**\n\nWe have a legitimate business interest
  in ensuring that our Site operates correctly and efficiently. To that end, we use
  the aggregated nonpersonal data and information from all users of our Site to measure
  server performance, analyze user traffic patterns, and improve the content of our
  Site. We sometimes track the keywords that are entered into our search engines to
  measure interest in specific topics and to improve the consumer experience on the
  site.\n\nWe have a legitimate business interest in communicating with you about
  your donations and subscriptions, and will use your personal information to send
  you important non-commercial emails, such as administrative notices related to your
  donations.\n\nWith your consent, we will use your e-mail address and/or other personal
  information to provide you with information we think you will be interested in,
  for example, to send you newsletters regarding services, events, and other information
  and notices we believe you may find interesting or useful. Even after you have agreed
  to receive such messages, you can let us know at any time if you would prefer not
  to receive any or all of this information either directly or through our Site, by
  following the unsubscribe instructions in any email you receive from us, or by sending
  an e-mail to [office@artandpractice.org](mailto:office@artandpractice.org) that
  contains the email address you wish us to unsubscribe from our lists. As noted above,
  even if you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we will still send you important
  non-commercial messages so long as you maintain your donations and/or subscriptions,
  or have maintained any electronic account with us. If you want to delete your account
  completely, you may do so by requesting we close your account as outlined in the
  Retention section of this Privacy Policy.\n\nWith your consent, we may share your
  information with key partners and affiliates, whose services we believe are of interest
  to you. We have contractual relationships with all such partners and affiliates
  that require them to safeguard your information and allow you to opt out of receiving
  further information from them. Once you have provided your consent for us to share
  your information, and those third parties reach to you directly, their use of your
  data is governed by their own privacy policies, and is not controlled by A+P. You
  can revoke your consent to receive any or all of this information by following the
  unsubscribe instructions in an email you\nreceive from one of our partners (this
  will only unsubscribe you from receiving further marketing messages from that partner),
  or by following any other instructions these partners may provide you. If you would
  like to revoke your consent to A+P sharing your information with its partners, you
  can do so by sending an e-mail to [office@artandpractice.org](mailto:office@artandpractice.org)
  that contains the email address you wish to revoke consent for third-party sharing.\n\nWe
  also have a legitimate business interest in complying with our legal obligations.
  To that end, we may release personal information if we believe in good faith that:
  the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request
  from a law enforcement agency; or such release is necessary to protect our rights,
  property, or safety, or that of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers,
  or others. Because the law provides we must retain and maintain records relating
  to donors, we are also obligated under the law to keep certain of your information
  and disclose it upon request or subpoena to government entities, such as the Internal\nRevenue
  Service.\n\nA+P uses third parties to process your personal data when it serves
  a legitimate business purpose (such as stripe.com for payment processing). Our contracts
  with these third party processors require them to comply with the terms and the
  intent of this privacy policy, and to make all commercially reasonable efforts to
  safeguard your information.\n\n**Access**\n\nPursuant to your reasonable request,
  we will provide you or a third-party you specify with a list of all of your personal
  information that A+P has collected. Similarly, upon your request, we will make corrections
  to our records of your personal data.\n\n**Retention**\n\nAs described above, some
  of the online services available through our Site allow you to provide personal
  information. All personal information we collect is stored and processed in the
  United States.\n\nWe will retain your personal information while you have an active
  relationship with A+P, including if you have subscribed to a newsletter, or opted
  in to receive fundraising content from us, have made a donation, or have affirmatively
  made requests of us that we, or our data processors, are fulfilling. We will maintain
  your information and for 30 days after that\nrelationship ends (unless you request
  that we delete your information prior to the expiration of that period). If A+P
  determines that it no longer requires your information for the purposes set forth
  above, it will delete your information consistent with its retention policies.\n\nIf
  you would like us to delete all of your personal information and/or remove your
  name and address from promotional lists (including any personal information gathered
  by our service providers) and place your name on our “do not contact” list, contact
  our Data Privacy Team at [office@artandpractice.org](mailto:office@artandpractice.org)
  and request that you be placed on our “do not contact” list. Please note that because
  names may be similar, you must include in your request all associated email\naddresses
  and phone numbers (if any) that you wish to be removed in the body of the email.
  We reserve the right to contact you for administrative purposes to request more
  information in order to assist us in deleting your content. We will make commercially
  reasonable efforts to delete your information within thirty (30) days from our active
  files, provided, however, that we may\nretain—for legal compliance purposes only—your
  request and associated email in a hashed format so that we do not inadvertently
  restore your information to our database. Please note that requests to update your
  personal information may take up to five (5) days. You may also request that we
  stop processing your information without deleting it, and we will comply within
  ten (10) days of receipt of such a request.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, A+P will
  retain your information indefinitely if it believes in good faith that it has a
  legal obligation to do so, including for tax purposes, but will only use that information
  for the specific necessary purpose for which it was retained.\n\n**Do-Not-Track
  Signal**\n\nThe Do-Not-Track Signal (“DNT”) is used by some web browsers to automatically
  request that a web application disable site tracking. Because the DNT often does
  not reflect the actual preferences of an individual consumer, our website does not
  respond to the DNT. Instead, and in order to allow you to personalize your experience
  with our Site, you may elect not to receive\nmarketing messages and/or have certain
  cookies placed on their browser, as discussed earlier in this Policy.\n\n**Children’s
  Access**\n\nThe Site is a general audience website, intended for adult use. We do
  not market to, and do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information
  from, children under sixteen (16) years of age. Children should always get permission
  from their parents before sending any personal\ninformation about themselves (such
  as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or
  to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's online experience,
  and to share your knowledge and experience with your young ones. If you’re under
  16, please do not register for any of our services or provide us with any personally
  identifying information (such as your name, email address or phone number). Please
  contact our customer service department if you are aware of any personal information
  supplied to the Site by a child under the age of sixteen (16).\n\n**Links**\n\nOur
  website may contain links to other sites, including those of our business collaborators.
  Those sites may have their own privacy policies, or no privacy policies at all.
  The A+P is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites and
  those other sites have not agreed to our privacy policy. The A+P has no control
  over or responsibility for any unaffiliated\nthird party sites or the content contained
  in them, and we provide these links solely for the convenience of our visitors.
  We do not sponsor, endorse, or otherwise recommend such sites or any products or
  services they may offer. In short, once you leave our Site, we are no longer responsible
  for the collection practices of the companies operating those sites.\n\n**Site Security**\n\nWe
  take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect unauthorized access,
  alteration or destruction of data located on and collected by our Site. We exercise
  reasonable care to protect your non-public personal information. Unfortunately,
  no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While
  we strive to protect your non-public\npersonal information, we cannot guarantee
  the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us while it is
  in transit. Once we receive your personal information, we maintain physical, electronic
  and procedural safeguards to protect it. If a data breach occurs, we will notify
  you and the proper EEA authority (if required) within seventy-two (72) hours (if
  reasonably feasible).\n\n**How to Contact Us**\n\nShould you have other questions
  or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact our office by phone at (323)
  337-6887, Monday through Friday, 8:30am to 5:00pm, Pacific Time, by email to [office@artandpractice.org](mailto:office@artandpractice.org),
  or by regular mail to:\nArt + Practice, 3401 W. 43rd Place, Los Angeles, CA 90008.\n\n**Policy
  Changes**\n\nWe reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add,
  or remove any portion of this Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, at any time.
  Modification of changes in the Agreement will be disseminated via our Site, including
  posting on our website at [http://www.artandpractice.org/privacypolicy/](http://www.artandpractice.org/privacypolicy/).
  By using the Site you agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore
  periodically visit the page to determine the then current terms of use to which
  you are bound."
