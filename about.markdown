    There are 28,000 foster youth living in Los Angeles County alone, representing 38% of California’s foster youth population. A+P is located in Service Planning Area (SPA) 6, a geographic region within Los Angeles County, as defined by the Department of Public Health. In SPA 6, the local high schools’ populations consist of up to 40% foster youth.

    Despite their concentration, foster youth inside SPA 6 suffer from a scarcity of services. To reverse this trend, A+P collaborates with First Place for Youth, a nonprofit that offers opportunities for local foster youth to receive housing as well as educational, employment, and personal support.

    In addition to the programs run by First Place, A+P also hires foster youth interns to work alongside A+P’s staff and assist with exhibitions, public programs, communications, visitor engagement, and security.

Conceived and founded by artist Mark Bradford, philanthropist and collector Eileen Harris Norton, and social activist Allan DiCastro, Art + Practice (A+P) is a private operating 501(c)3 foundation based in Leimert Park, Los Angeles. A+P has two areas of focus which together embody its commitment to supporting the needs of its local foster youth while also providing the community with free access to museum-curated contemporary art:

- An exhibition space for museum-curated contemporary art and a public program space for moderated art lectures and discussions organized to coincide with exhibitions on view
- A space where foster youth may receive life-skills training, access to housing opportunities, and individualized education and employment support via its foster youth service collaborator, First Place for Youth

The organization occupies a nearly 20,000-square-foot campus in Leimert Park, from which it directs its programs and activities. Admission to all exhibitions and public programs is free and open to the public.
