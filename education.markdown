about_text: "Education at A+P is designed as an outreach program to meet teachers
  where they are in terms of curriculum and familiarity with contemporary art. A+P
  invites local schools, students and teachers to experience, analyze and engage with
  exhibitions on view in A+P’s exhibition space in Leimert Park, Los Angeles. Teachers
  receive self-guided teacher resource guides with grade appropriate student handouts
  (grades K-12) that seamlessly integrate into their curriculum and incorporate the
  California State Contents Standards (VAPA and ELA).\n\n### So how do K-12 visits
  actually work?\n\nTeachers schedule their visit through A+P by emailing education@artandpractice.org.
  A+P then provides scheduled schools located within 7 miles radius of A+P’s campus
  with paid bus transportation. Field trip reservations are always required with a
  minimum of 3 weeks notice.\nUpon arrival to A+P’s exhibition space, school groups
  are greeted by A+P’s staff and receive clipboards with student handouts (grades
  K-12). Teachers receive a corresponding teacher resource guide that includes the
  tools teachers need to carry out select activities for the tour as well as follow
  up lessons in the classroom. \n\n### Can I bring my college/university or adult
  class?\n\nA+P welcomes students and educators of all ages to explore and learn about
  exhibitions on view. Please note that the maximum size of a visiting group is 60
  students. Groups of 30 or less are highly encouraged. E-mail [education@artandpractice.org](mailto:education@artandpractice.org)
  to schedule your visit."
