    Conceived and founded by artist Mark Bradford, philanthropist and collector Eileen Harris Norton, and social activist Allan DiCastro, Art \+ Practice (A\+P) is a private operating 501(c)3 foundation based in Leimert Park, Los Angeles. A\+P has two areas of focus which together embody its commitment to supporting the needs of its local foster youth while also providing the community with access to free contemporary art:

    * An exhibition space for museum-curated contemporary art and a public program space for moderated art lectures and discussions organized to coincide with museum-curated exhibitions on view

    * A space where foster youth may receive life-skills training, access to housing opportunities, and individualized education and employment support via its foster youth service collaborator, First Place for Youth

    The organization occupies a nearly 20,000-square-foot campus in Leimert Park, from which it directs its programs and activities. Admission to all exhibitions and public programs is free and open to the public.
