  biography_text: "Maren Hassinger’s life and career bridge Los Angeles and Baltimore.
    \ An LA native and 1973 UCLA graduate, Hassinger was active with an experimental
    group of artists in the city, including Senga Nengudi and David Hammons, during
    the 1970s. Hassinger’s work of this time, as well as that of her colleagues has
    recently been chronicled in Kellie Jones’s book _South of Pico: African American
    Artists in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s_. Hassinger then moved to the East
    Coast, spending time in New York City and East Hampton before becoming the Director
    of the Rinehart School of Graduate Sculpture at Baltimore’s prestigious Maryland
    Institute College of Art, a position she has held since 1997. Alongside her solo
    work, Hassinger has continued collaborations with Nengudi and performed with her
    daughter, artist Ava Hassinger, under the name “Matriarch.” She is now based in
    New York City.\n\nRecognized as an influential teacher and a pioneer of such ephemeral
    practices as performance and site-specific interventions, Hassinger has received
    numerous honors including awards and grants from Anonymous Was a Woman, the International
    Association of Art Critics, the Gottlieb Foundation, the Joan Mitchell Foundation,
    the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. \n\nShe
    was the subject of a 2015 retrospective at Spelman College Museum of Art in Atlanta.
    Her work was also included in the recent traveling group exhibitions _Now Dig
    This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960-1980_ (originating at the Hammer Museum,
    Los Angeles and traveling to PS1, Long Island City; and Williams College, Williamstown,
    MA) and _Radical Presence: Black Performance in Contemporary Art_ (originating
    at the  Contemporary Art Museum, Houston; and traveling to the Grey Art Gallery
    and Studio Museum, New York; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, the Yerba Buena Center
    for the Arts, San Francisco), as well as the 2017 exhibition _We Wanted a Revolution:
    Black Radical Women, 1965-85_ at the Brooklyn Museum of Art."

For over four decades, Maren Hassinger has explored relationships between the industrial and natural worlds in a practice that is both meditative and critical. From the 1970s on, her sculpture has incorporated common materials associated with manufacturing, mass media, and commerce. In abstract compositions such as those that will be on view at Art + Practice, she transforms wire rope, newspapers, plastic bags, and more into evocations of the beauty found in conditions often dismissed as blighted or marginal.  

Hassinger is also a formative practitioner of performance art and site-specific interventions, collaborating with Senga Nengudi and other LA-based artists during the 1970s. Her performances involve dance, as well as movements observed from everyday life, and investigate communal activity and commonalities amongst groups of people. This important body of work will be documented in photographs within the show.
Additionally, Hassinger has produced moving videos that address race, gender, and other aspects of identity. Examples included at Art + Practice explore these themes through Hassinger’s interactions with her family members. In one work, she learns for the first time about aspects of her family’s history by interviewing her uncle. In another, filmed in a beautiful East Hampton seaside setting, she engages in improvisational choreography with her daughter, artist Ava Hassinger.   

With its focus on relationships between people, materials, and environments, Hassinger’s art is frequently described as “ecological.” The artist clarifies this observation, stating: “I don’t think my work has so much to do with ecology, but focuses on elements, or even problems - social and environmental - that we all share, and in which we all have a stake.  I don’t think that’s an ecological statement.  I want it to be a humane and humanistic statement about our future together.”

_Maren Hassinger: The Spirit of Things_ is co-presented by The Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) and Art + Practice and is organized by the BMA’s Senior Curator of Contemporary Art Kristen Hileman.
