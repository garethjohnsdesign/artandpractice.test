  biography_text: "Born in Oceanside, CA, in 1974, Ruben Ochoa’s practice engages
    space as both a concept and a material.  Often produced with material forms associated
    with construction, Ochoa’s works expose the ideological and broader sociopolitical
    and economic relationships that facilitate the way spaces we inhabit and move
    through are assembled. \n\nHis work has been the subject of various solo exhibitions,
    including, _Watching, Waiting, Commiserating_, Museum of Contemporary Art, San
    Diego, CA (2016); _MATRIX 169: Cloudless Day_, Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art,
    Hartford, CT (2014); _Cores and Cutouts_, Locust Projects, Miami, FL (2011); _Building
    on the Fringes of Tomorrow_, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA (2010);
    and _Crooked Under the Weight_, Site Santa Fe, Santa Fe, NM (2009) amongst others.
    Ochoa’s work has also been included in a host of group exhibitions, most notably,
    _Down These Mean Streets_, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C. (2017);
    _99 cents or Less_, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, MI (2017); _Mi Tierra_,
    Denver Art Museum, Denver, CO (2017); _Routes of Influence_, Perez Art Museum,
    Miami, FL (2016); _Apparition: Frottages and Rubbings from 1860 to Now_, Hammer
    Museum, Los Angeles, CA and Menil Collection, Houston, TX (2015); _X-Change_,
    Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas, TX (2013); _The Future Generation Art Prize Exhibition_,
    Venice, Italy (2011); _The Artist’s Museum: Los Angeles Artists 1980-2010_, Museum
    of Contemporary, Los Angeles, CA (2010); _Phantom Sighting_, LACMA, Los Angeles,
    CA (2008); and the 2008 Whitney Biennial, New York, NY amongst others. \n\nIn
    addition to his exhibitions, Ochoa has completed various public art projects including,
    most notably, _Fwy Wall Extraction_ (2006-2007) and _CLASS: C_ (2001-2005). Ochoa’s
    work is included in the collections of the Perez Art Museum, the Hammer Museum,
    LACMA, the MCA San Diego; MOCA; the Phoenix Art Museum; the Smithsonian Museum
    of Art; the Orange County Museum of Art; and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
    \n\nHe is the recipient of numerous awards including a California Community Foundation
    Fellowship and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He received his BFA from Otis College
    of Art and Design and his MFA from UC Irvine. He lives and works in Los Angeles,
    CA. \n"

abstract_text: "Oceanside-born, Los Angeles-based artist Ruben Ochoa’s practice, like
  that of a land surveyor’s, engages space as both a concept and a collection of material
  forms that structure human life. For Ochoa, space is the product of specific and
  intentioned acts rather than a naturalized entity. Using materials that makeup the
  built environment—concrete, metals, wood—Ochoa creates artworks that reveal how
  construction techniques shape the spaces people inhabit and in turn directly impact
  their access and mobility. \n\nWhile previous exhibitions of Ochoa’s work have focused
  on his masterful use of materials and his generative contributions to sculpture,
  seldom have his works been contextualized as articulations of a spatial practice.
  Ruben Ochoa brings together a focused selection of the artist’s early and more recent
  artworks that highlight his long-standing interest in space and his interrogations
  of the processes that bring it to being. "

Oceanside-born, Los Angeles-based artist Ruben Ochoa’s practice, like that of a land surveyor’s, engages space as both a concept and a collection of material forms that structure human life. For Ochoa, space is the product of specific and intentioned acts rather than a naturalized entity. Using materials that makeup the built environment—concrete, metals, wood—Ochoa creates artworks that reveal how construction techniques shape the spaces people inhabit and in turn directly impact their access and mobility. 

While previous exhibitions of Ochoa’s work have focused on his masterful use of materials and his generative contributions to sculpture, seldom have his works been contextualized as articulations of a spatial practice. _SAMPLED y SURVEYED_ brings together a focused selection of the artist’s early and more recent artworks that highlight his long-standing interest in space and his interrogations of the processes that bring it to being. 

The first part of the exhibition gathers key large-scale works, each produced through a specific construction tactic—extraction, framing, obstruction, reinforcement. Collectively, these works structure and manipulate the way bodies move—shedding light on the often concealed intentions that give way to the spaces people inhabit and navigate through in their daily lives. The second part of the exhibition, envisioned like a drafting room, focuses on the lives and conditions of materials. Bringing together a selection of rubbings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, and installations, this part of the exhibition explores how materials themselves are imbued with charged histories as a result of their making, their use, and the economies in which they circulate. When put to the service of construction, what Ochoa shows us are the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural differences inherent in the physical makeup of the environments people exist in and the possibility of an expanded definition of place, locality, landscape, territory, city, and more broadly, geography—or what geographer Edward W. Soja once called "the spatiality of human life." 

_SAMPLED y SURVEYED_ is organized by Art + Practice and guest curated by César García, Executive and Artistic Director of The Mistake Room.
