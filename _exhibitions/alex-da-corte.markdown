abstract_text: The Philadelphia-based interdisciplinary artist **Alex Da Corte** (b.
  1980, Camden, NJ) is known for his pop-informed sensibility and embrace of theatricality.
  In his elaborate, surreal set pieces, banal objects and consumer goods serve as
  both actors and props. Da Corte’s videos, sculptures, paintings, and installations
  ruminate on personal and cultural politics, alienation, and the complexities of
  the human experience. An active scavenger of high and low culture, his material
  explorations have included using dollar-store soda and shampoo as paint; “curating”
  the works of other artists into hybrid objects; and creating immersive environments
  that consider and modify the entirety of a space, from lighting fixtures to flooring.
  For his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles, Da Corte will present a survey of
  recent videos within a site-specific installation at Art + Practice.

For his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles, Da Corte will present a survey of recent videos within a site-specific installation at Art + Practice.

The Philadelphia-based interdisciplinary artist Alex Da Corte (b. 1980, Camden, NJ) is known for his pop-informed sensibility and embrace of theatricality. In his elaborate, surreal set pieces, banal objects and consumer goods serve as both actors and props. Da Corte’s videos, sculptures, paintings, and installations ruminate on personal and cultural politics, alienation, and the complexities of the human experience. An active scavenger of high and low culture, his material explorations have included using dollar-store soda and shampoo as paint; “curating” the works of other artists into hybrid objects; and creating immersive environments that consider and modify the entirety of a space, from lighting fixtures to flooring. 

_Alex Da Corte: A Season in He’ll_ is organized by Jamillah James, Hammer Museum assistant curator.
