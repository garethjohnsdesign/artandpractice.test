    Born in Detroit in 1935, Loving relocated to New York in 1968. Unlike other African-American artists whose art focused on the racial politics of the era, Loving was a staunch abstractionist. His works were built upon strict yet simple geometric shapes—often hexagonal or cubic modules. Inspired by Hans Hoffmann (who taught Loving’s mentor Al Mullen), Loving concentrated on the tension between flatness and spatial illusionism. He explored this tension using a hard-edged geometric vocabulary related to Minimalism—as in Untitled, 1969, which uses a strategic layering of cubic forms and juxtaposition of warm and cool colors to create an optical play of three-dimensionality.

    Throughout his career, Loving had solo exhibitions at many well-known institutions, including: Gertrude Kasle Gallery (1969, 1970, Detroit), William Zierler, Inc. (1971, 1972, 1973, New York), Fischbach Gallery (1974, 1976, New York), The Studio Museum in Harlem (1977, 1986, New York), Diane Brewer Gallery (1980, 1983, New York), June Kelly Gallery (1988, 1990, 1992, New York), the Neuberger Museum of Art (1998, Purchase, New York), and Kenkeleba House (2005, New York). His work was also featured in many important group exhibitions, such as _L’art vivant aux États-Unis_ (1970, Fondation Maeght, Saint-Paul, France), _Contemporary Black Artists in America_ (1971, Whitney Museum of American Art), _Lamp Black: Afro-American Artists_, New York and Boston (1973, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), _Another Generation_ (1979, The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York), _Afro-American Abstraction_ (1981, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, Queens), and _The Appropriate Object_ (1989, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo), among others. Most recently, Loving’s work appeared in _High Times, Hard Times: New York Painting, 1967–1975_ (2006, Weatherspoon Art Museum, University of North Carolina, Greensboro), _Target Practice: Painting Under Attack_, 1949–1978 (2009, Seattle Art Museum), _America is Hard to See_ (2015, Whitney Museum of American Art), and _Marrakech Biennale 6_ (2016, Morocco).

    Loving’s work is featured in the collections of major museums around the country, including: Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas; the Detroit Institute of Arts; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Museum of Modern Art; the National Gallery of Art; the Pérez Art Museum Miami; the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Rose Art Museum, Waltham, Massachusetts; and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

For forty years, Loving experimented with materials and process to expand the definition of modern painting, drawing on everything from free jazz to his family’s quilting tradition. In the 1980s, Loving broke free of the flat image, using heavy rag paper to make three-dimensional collages in brilliant colors. At A+P, Spiral Play will feature twelve of these collages, some of them monumental in scale. The work is radical, beautiful, and deeply human.

Loving was born in Detroit in 1935. He received his MFA at the University of Michigan, training in an Abstract Expressionist, gestural painting style. In 1968, Loving moved to New York City to engage in more active dialogue with his peers, and shifted to a hard-edge geometric mode.  After less than a year in New York, he was offered a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which won critical acclaim. Despite his success, Loving felt trapped inside “the box” of geometric abstraction at a charged political moment—as if his art and his life were out of alignment. In the 1970s, he discovered a method of working with torn, dyed, and sewn canvas, drawing on quilting traditions, that rendered his paintings more vibrant and immediate. From the 1980s onward, Loving experimented with large scale collages that expanded into space, reconciling geometry and an expression of life force through profound and playful organic form.  

_Spiral Play: Loving in the '80s_ is curated by Christopher Bedford, the Dorothy Wagner Wallis Director of The Baltimore Museum of Art, and Katy Siegel, the Thaw Endowed Chair at Stony Brook University and Senior Curator at the Baltimore Museum of Art.  This exhibition is presented by Art + Practice and The Baltimore Museum of Art.
