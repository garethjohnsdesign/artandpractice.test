  Many of the young people who come to First Place for Youth are struggling to complete high school, persist in a postsecondary pathway, or obtain full-time employment. The education and employment support services offered by First Place are designed to meet the unique needs of current and former foster youth as they plan for their futures based on their strengths and interests. Each young person who joins First Place is assigned an Education and Employment Specialist who supports youth in completing their high school diploma or GED Certificate and, once eligible, enrolling in college.

  The Education and Employment Specialist’s goal is to provide each young person with the best possible support targeted to their immediate needs and future plans. Educational and Employment Specialists are there every step of the way to teach and motivate, with the goals of helping each young person set educational and career goals, create a plan to reach them, and build the skills required to succeed.

  Common areas of support include:

  * Education planning and course selection

  * Academic coaching, tutoring, and study skills

  * Postsecondary admissions and nancial aid processes

  * Job search and application strategies

  * Interview preparation

  * Workplace readiness skills

  * Career Pathway counseling
