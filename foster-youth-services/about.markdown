  More than 400,000 foster youth currently live in the United States, including some 60,000 in California with 30% living in Los Angeles County. A+P is located within Service Planning Area (SPA) 6, a specific geographic region within Los Angeles County, as defined by the Department of Public Health. SPA 6 is home to a large concentration of foster youth.

  Despite their concentration, foster youth inside SPA 6 suffer from a scarcity of services. To combat this trend, A+P currently collaborates with nonprofit social service provider First Place for Youth to provide paid internships within A+P’s contemporary art programs. Additionally, A+P provides First Place with a structured environment on its campus, where the nonprofit can offer opportunities for local foster youth to receive individualized educational, employment and personal support.

    Founded in 1998, First Place for Youth is a nonprofit organization helping foster youth build the skills they need to make a successful transition to self-sufficiency and responsible adulthood. First Place supports foster youth, ages 18 to 24, at a critical time in their lives when they need to learn to support themselves.
    First Place for Youth offers My First Place Program at A+P. My First Place is a nationally recognized model that provides foster youth with access to safe, affordable housing combined with intensive, weekly case management, individualized education and employment support, and job development and linked learning opportunities.
    With results-driven service to foster youth, First Place is helping to change public policies that improve the lives and reshape the landscape for foster youth living in California.

    A+P launched its paid foster youth internship program on its campus in 2017. Organized in collaboration with First Place for Youth, A+P currently hires foster youth to work in its exhibition space and administrative office.

As part of the internships, foster youth receive special trainings for their positions.

    Current internships offered at A+P:
    * Security and Community Engagement Internship (up to 4 months)
    * Administrative and Communications Internship (up to 6 months)
