    **EDUCATION \+ EMPLOYMENT**


    Many of the young people who come to First Place for Youth are struggling to complete high school, persist in a post-secondary pathway, or obtain full-time employment. The education and employment support services offered by First Place are designed to meet the unique needs of current and former foster youth as they plan for their futures based on their strengths and interests. Each young person who joins First Place is assigned an Education and Employment Specialist who supports youth in completing their high school diploma or GED Certificate and, once eligible, enrolling in college.

    **HOUSING**


    First Place for Youth’s program participants live in one- or two-bedroom apartments scattered throughout the community. They receive assistance with basic living expenses, and receive intensive case management and education and employment support services. The foundation provided by stable housing empowers young people to build communities, pursue their dreams, and pave their own way for successful, independent living for years to come.
