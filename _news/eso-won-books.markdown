Less than two years ago, the artist Mark Bradford’s ambitious Leimert Park gallery and social services complex  Art + Practice opened with a Hammer Museum collaboration, displaying works by Charles Gaines in a temporary space.

On Saturday, A+P launches a new 6,000-square-foot gallery space with its debut show, “Black, White, Gray,” an exhibition of works by sculptor Fred Eversley. 

Based in Venice, Eversley is known for creating pieces that offer beguiling plays on color and light. He is a key figure in the California Light and Space Movement, fabricating cast-resin pieces that evoke mirrors and lenses. (Look through one of his pieces and you will see the space before you bent, distorted and stretched.)

Like the 2015 Gaines show, the Eversley exhibition is another museum collaboration, this time with the Rose Art Museum in Massachusetts. 

“The Rose developed the curatorial program,” says Sophia Belsheim, Art + Practice’s director of operations. “We supply the space. Fred has a studio in Abbot Kinney. We’re excited to be doing this show.”

The opening of the expansive gallery space at the corner of Degnan Boulevard and West 43rd Place — which at one point housed a chain drug store and later a beauty supply shop — marks a number of shifts for A+P. Established by Bradford with his partner, Allan DiCastro, and prominent L.A. art collector Eileen Norton, the organization operates a checkerboard of properties in the neighborhood. Some of these are still taking shape.
