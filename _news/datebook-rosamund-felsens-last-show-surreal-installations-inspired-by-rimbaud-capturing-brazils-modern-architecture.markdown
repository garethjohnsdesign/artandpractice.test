A long-time Los Angeles gallery puts on its final show. A German photographer explores Brazil’s tropical Modernism. And wild installations take on identity, alienation and the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. Plus: The wry drawings of a California ceramicist and the flamboyant designs of a prominent Palm Springs architect. Here are six events to check out this week:

Alex Da Corte, “A Season in He’ll,” at Art + Practice. An exhibition by the New Jersey-born conceptual artist includes a series of works inspired by French poet Arthur Rimbaud’s influential prose poem, “A Season in Hell,” which explores topics of morality, desire and death. In video and in sculptural installations — works that employ banal consumer goods and pop cultural tropes — Da Corte takes on these topics and others, touching on issues of identity, alienation and instability. Opens Saturday at 4 p.m. and runs through Sept. 17.
