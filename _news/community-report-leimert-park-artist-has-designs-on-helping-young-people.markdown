Public art has the capacity to transform a community. It tells the history of a city better than any textbook. It reveals personal truth and spurs people to action.

The freedom of expression acknowledges human suffering and offers those who have suffered the opportunity to tell their truth to the world.

Whether it’s the mural on your drive to work or the song lyric coming through your headphones, art has touched and changed all of us. It has comforted us by helping us realize that we aren’t alone: someone else has felt the same sadness and joy. Art reminds us of our common humanity.

I was reminded of this when I recently saw _Manifest Justice_, a pop-up art exhibit in South L.A.

If you saw the art show, you’ll understand its power and I’m sure you left that building feeling shaken. The work displayed was powerful. It forced viewers to confront the anger and power of the racial divides in our country.

The exhibit was designed to educate and agitate — that’s what happens when you confront injustice.

It was peppered with statistics: California spends $62,300 each year to keep one inmate in prison, and just $9,100 per year per public student.

Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, came to tell Los Angeles how her son’s death pushed her to social activism; an artistic rendering of her son stood close by, with a halo hovering above his hoodie.

As I moved through the gallery, I spotted a police car from Ferguson, Missouri, with its windows blown out and its doors bashed in. Through its roof grew cacti and palm leaves, pushing through the car ceiling.

From the dust and wreckage and violence of a city torn apart by fear and racism, new life grew.

I left the exhibit reminded of L.A.’s own history of riots and heartened by our city’s commitment to smart, humane, relationship-based policing, while never forgetting the lives we lost and businesses we burned.

Los Angeles has a long history of producing art that changes the world. After all, Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles once called Leimert Park home.

Earlier this year, I met Mark Bradford, an artist who grew up in Leimert Park, painting signs for his mother’s beauty parlor that read “PRESS AND CURL $25.”

Today, Bradford has taken over that same salon, transforming it into his art studio.

His latest project is Art + Practice, an arts and education campus that takes up half a dozen buildings in Leimert Park that will soon be occupied by artist studios, exhibition spaces and book stores.
