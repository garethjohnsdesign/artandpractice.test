Outside the pristine white warehouse that houses Art + Practice is a lively street filled with chatter and laughter. Inside, stillness: the silent scores of Charles Gaines' solemn "Librettos: Manuel de Falla/Stokely Carmichael." At first glance, the white cube gallery seems far removed from the vibrant neighborhood in which it sits. Anticipating a community center, one instead finds a museum. The Gaines show is programmed by the Hammer Museum as a complement to the L.A.-based artist's retrospective "Gridwork: 1974-1989" and installed as impeccably as its pedigree would indicate. Yet the values that underpin Art + Practice are not those of a typical art museum, in which silent reflection in the company of objects is generally of primary importance while audience engagement is a secondary, if growing, priority. Flipping this equation, Art + Practice foregrounds social welfare services while preserving a space for quiet contemplation that many of its constituents are rarely able to access. This combination presents uncommon advantages as well as challenges, positioning the organization to serve two very different constituencies with potentially complementary, but also conflicting, needs and expectations.

 

Art + Practice is a non-profit launched by celebrated artist and MacArthur fellow Mark Bradford with partners, social activist Allan diCastro and collector and philanthropist Eileen Harris Norton, in Leimert Park. The new space joins neighbors Papillion Art, The World Stage, KAOS Network, and Eso Won Books (soon to relocate to a space within Art + Practice) within the arts corridor along Degnan and Leimert Boulevards. This is one of Los Angeles' most compelling and long-established arts enclaves, representing the spectrum of performing, cinematic, literary, and visual arts. Says diCastro, Art + Practice's Interim Executive Director, "we are dovetailing into an already existing history of cultural variety." Spaces with a quarter-century of history in the neighborhood intersperse with new arrivals bearing a post-conceptual aesthetic. "In order to change things and be a part of the conversation, you have to take a vested interest in the neighborhood," explains Bradford in the catalogue that accompanied Art + Practice's recent launch. "You have to be present in the community." Through both its architecture and its programming, Art + Practice reflects the shifting concerns of Leimert Park's long-established Black community as the neighborhood responds to economic and social changes and prepares for still more. The pending arrival of the Crenshaw/LAX Metro in 2019 has many residents anticipating sweeping changes as the close-knit and somewhat isolated local community expands to accommodate an influx of newcomers. At the same time, local artists and activists are working to ensure that the established cultural character of the neighborhood is not lost as so often happens when ethnic strongholds become desirable real estate.
